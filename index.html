			Hi there! I'm Joshua Varghese, and I'm thrilled that you're here. I grew up in the vibrant and diverse Chicagoland area, where my love for learning, exploring, and connecting with people first took root. I ventured out to the beautiful city of Madison to pursue both my bachelor's and master's degrees in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Along the way, I've had the incredible opportunity to explore new horizons through internships in Raleigh, North Carolina, and the fast-paced energy of New York City.

		<p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto; color: #555;">
			When I'm not diving into my professional passions, you can find me chasing adventures in my personal life. I'm a huge fan of competitive sports like volleyball and basketball, and I thrive on the thrill of a close game. I'm also a self-proclaimed foodie, always on the hunt to discover the next amazing restaurant or unique food spot. In my free time, I enjoy working on creative side projects like developing data-driven tools and building smart devices that make everyday life a little easier.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto; color: #555;">
			Professionally, I pride myself on being a strong and compassionate leader. I believe that true leadership is about listening, understanding, and helping others grow into their full potential. Whether collaborating on cutting-edge technology, driving team success, or tackling challenging problems, I approach every endeavor with creativity, innovation, and an unwavering commitment to advancing the field I'm in.
		</p>
		<p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; max-width: 800px; margin: 20px auto; color: #555;">
			I’m excited to share my journey with you, and I hope you’ll explore the rest of my portfolio to learn more about my work and experiences!
